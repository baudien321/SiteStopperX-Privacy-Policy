# Privacy Policy for SiteStopperX

**Last Updated: July 26, 2024**

Thank you for using SiteStopperX ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you when you use our Chrome Extension (the "Service").

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information that is essential for the functionality of the Service and to provide you with a seamless experience.

### 1.1. Information You Provide to Us

*   **Account Information:** When you create a SiteStopperX account, we collect your email address. This is used for authentication, account management, and communication.
*   **User Settings:** We collect and store your extension settings, which include your enabled blocking categories (e.g., Adult, Gambling, Social), your custom-created whitelists, and your custom blocklists.

### 1.2. Information We Collect Automatically

*   **Web History (for Blocking Purposes):** The core function of our Service requires us to access the URL of the websites you visit. This check is performed in real-time to determine if the site should be blocked according to your settings. This browsing data is processed locally and is not stored or transmitted, except for aggregated, non-personally identifiable statistics (e.g., the number of times a domain was blocked).
*   **Subscription Information:** If you subscribe to our Pro plan, our payment processor, Stripe, will handle your payment information. We receive a token from Stripe that confirms your subscription status (e.g., "active," "canceled"), which we store to provide you with Pro features. We do not collect or store your credit card numbers or other sensitive financial details.
*   **Security and Log Data:** Our backend provider, Supabase, may automatically collect log information, including IP addresses, for security, debugging, and to prevent abuse of the service. This data is not used to track your specific location.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** To authenticate you, operate the blocking functionality, and sync your settings across devices.
*   **To Manage Your Account:** To manage your subscription status and provide you with customer support.
*   **To Improve Our Service:** To understand usage patterns and improve the user experience.
*   **For Security:** To protect the Service from fraud and abuse.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share your information with the following third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf:

*   **Supabase:** Our backend infrastructure provider for authentication, database storage (for your settings), and Edge Functions.
*   **Stripe:** Our payment processor for handling Pro subscriptions.

These service providers have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Your settings are stored in a secure database, and all payment information is handled by Stripe, which is a certified PCI Service Provider Level 1.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

You can access and update your settings at any time through the extension's options page. You may also delete your account, which will remove your account information and associated settings from our database.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
